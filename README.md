# dancing-cube

## Introduction

> Dancing Cube is a cube-shaped desk lamp which animates to the music beat. The secret behind it ? Arduino, an LED strip, few LEDs and a tiny microphone. Although my knowledge in regards to sound and music is quite limited, I have always found this form of expression extremely inspiring. I often listen to music while coding and brainstorming ideas to extract the most out of my brain. Dancing Cube is a cube-shaped desk lamp made with semi-transparent acrylic. It can either be used as a static lamp or it can react to the music beat flashing out different colour shades.
